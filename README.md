Detailed Description
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a role-based, Java-powered web application designed to streamline and automate the key functions of hospital operations. With a focus on simplicity, scalability, and ease of access, this system centralizes data and actions related to doctors, patients, appointments, and specialists. It is developed as a dynamic web project using Java Server Pages (JSP) and Servlets for the web interface and backend logic.

At the core of the system are five major entities: Doctor, Patient, Appointment, Admin, and Specialist. These entities are interconnected and reflect the real-world relationships within a hospital setting. The system is primarily managed by an Admin, who can create, update, and monitor doctors, patients, appointments, and specialists. Admins also have the exclusive ability to add new specialists and view all registered doctors in the system.

From the patient's perspective, the system is intuitive and simple to use. Patients can register and make appointments by choosing their preferred doctor or a specialist based on their medical needs. This feature facilitates better communication and service coordination between patients and healthcare providers.

On the technology side, the application was developed in IntelliJ IDEA using Java, Servlets, and JSP under the Jakarta EE framework. The backend is powered by a PostgreSQL database, with JDBC used to connect and interact with the database. The project is deployed using the SmartTomcat server, which integrates directly with IntelliJ for easier testing and deployment. All entities and records are stored persistently in the PostgreSQL database, and managed through standard SQL operations via JDBC.

This project demonstrates the effective use of Java EE technologies to build a simple yet functional hospital management solution. The architecture ensures that it is easy to maintain and expand, making it a suitable foundation for more advanced hospital systems with additional features like doctor logins, medical records, prescriptions, and more.
